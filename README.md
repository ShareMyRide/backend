# ShareMyRide-Transport Helping Mobile App
"ShareMyRide" is an innovative mobile application designed to revolutionize the way people commute by leveraging the power of ride-sharing. This platform aims to connect drivers who have extra seats in their vehicles with passengers who are traveling along the same route. By facilitating these connections, ShareMyRide not only helps to reduce travel costs for individuals but also promotes more efficient use of transportation resources and contributes to environmental sustainability by reducing the number of vehicles on the road.
