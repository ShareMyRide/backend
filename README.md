# ShareMyRide-Transport Helping Mobile App
<p>"ShareMyRide" is an innovative mobile application designed to revolutionize the way people commute by leveraging the power of ride-sharing.
This platform aims to connect drivers who have extra seats in their vehicles with passengers who are traveling along the same route.
By facilitating these connections, ShareMyRide not only helps to reduce travel costs for individuals but also promotes 
more efficient use of transportation resources and contributes to environmental sustainability by reducing the number of vehicles on the road.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Most people commute daily, mostly alone in their vehicles. This increases the level of traffic congestion and fuel consumption, 
and in turn, pollution in the environment. The cost associated with commuting can also become a heavy burden for the majority. Although there exists public transportation, it may not be useful or accessible to all, hence there seems to be the need for a solution 
to make commuting more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly.ShareMyRide connects drivers with available seats in their vehicles to passengers traveling the same route. This application aims to optimize travel resources, reduce transportation costs, and promote eco-friendly commuting.</p>
